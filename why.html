        <h2>Why</h2>
        <p class="pb-large">Throughout my career, I have worked to increase educational access and achievement for students from a variety of backgrounds, cultures, and communities, but most especially for students from underserved groups. Through these experiences, I learned that one cannot increase educational access and achievement by just providing students with equal resources and opportunities. Instead, one must provide students with equitable resources and opportunities— the ones they need to learn and thrive— so that they are able to reach their highest potential. It has become my mission to make education for students more inclusive and equitable, and my past experiences in education have given me ideas for how I will start to do so in my classroom. However, I will not stop there. Making education more inclusive and equitable is something I will always be working towards as an educator, and I am ready, willing, and excited to put in the time and effort needed to learn how to do it better.</p>
