        <p class="text-body"><b>Hello, my name is Sophia Suzuki-Jones!</b> A little about me...I was lucky enough to be born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii! While growing up on the beautiful island of Oahu, I developed a love for the ocean and a deep passion for environmental conservation. And so, after graduating high school from Punahou School, I left Hawaii to attend the University of Redlands, where I received a B.S. in Environmental Science and minors in both Government and Spatial Studies- Geographic Information Systems.</p>

          <p class="text-body">At the end of my time at the University of Redlands, I received the amazing opportunity to assist my professor, Timothy Krantz, in his research project to compile a geographic information database for Tetiaroa atoll (also called Marlon Brando’s atoll) in French Polynesia. For a month, we did GIS mapping, kite aerial photography, water and stromatolite sampling of the island’s koparas, DNA sampling of fish and eel populations, and ground-nesting bird density surveys of the atoll. It was truly a once in a lifetime experience that I will never forget!</p>

            During my time at the University of Redlands and post graduation, I worked for The Nature Conservancy on projects in Colorado and Mississippi. In Colorado, I worked on stewardship and outreach projects at Phantom Canyon Preserve. And in Mississippi, I worked on coastal conservation projects, collecting data on oyster reef habitats’ recovery from the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

          <p class="text-body">After those amazing experiences, I decided to return to California to work for the non-profit, Ocean Discovery Institute, where I provided informal science education to elementary and middle school students in underserved communities in San Diego. Through this experience, I saw some of the injustices and inequalities that students faced in the classroom, and I was driven to become a teacher. After finishing my time at Ocean Discovery, I started my credential and master’s program at the University of San Diego. Currently, I am in my last semester of the program and will be graduating in the spring of 2018!</p>
          <p class="text-body">I have love and appreciation for every single second of my journey to become a teacher, and I am so excited for all of the times to come!</p>
